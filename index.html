        <p> - Participants in Model United Nations conferences, known as delegates, are placed in committees and assigned countries to represent, or occasionally other organizations or political figures, where they represent members of that body. Delegates
            are assigned countries before the conference, along with receiving a topic, or topics, that their committee will discuss. Delegates conduct research before conferences, formulate positions and come up with policy proposals that they will then
            debate with their fellow delegates in the committee, staying true to the actual position of the member they represent.At the end of a conference, the delegates will vote on written policies, called “draft resolutions”, with the goal of passing
            them with a majority vote. The best-performing delegates in each committee, as well as delegations, are sometimes recognized with awards.</p>
