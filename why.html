    <p>Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an educational simulation and/or academic activity in which students can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves and teaches participants speaking,
        debating, and writing skills, in addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities. Usually an extracurricular activity, some schools also offer Model UN as a class. It is meant to engage students and allow them to develop deeper
        understanding into current world issues.</p>
    <h1 class="lol"><u>Benefits</u></h1>
    <p>Worldly Knowledge Keeping up with world affairs may get dull at times by simply reading news articles or watching video news programmes. By participating in MUNs, your knowledge of the world will increase tremendously as you represent a country at
        a ‘global’ level and interact with other delegates representing other countries. As a delegate, you will be required to research your allotted countries in-depth, analysing and understanding their foreign policies and considering which factors
        would influence the behaviour of the country at an international level. As you study the intricacies of the issue – the background, history, treatment in the UN, and previous resolutions passed on it – you will gain practical and thorough knowledge
        of world affairs. Recommended Read: Exhaustive Guide To A Career In International Relations: Scope, Colleges & Opportunities 2. Confidence-Building A MUN involves meeting new people, interacting with unfamiliar faces, working in teams to develop
        resolutions to assigned tasks and to express views in a self-assured manner. From preparing for the MUNs to the discussions, debates, and resolutions made during the MUN, the entire experience will serve to boost your confidence. After participating
        in a MUN, you will feel much more comfortable about working with new people and expressing yourself easily. The confidence gained will help you in future interactions where you would need to express yourself in high-pressure situations. Recommended

        is an ideal place to hone analytical skills, as in a simulated environment you will be challenged and required to solve the task after examining the concerns of the other countries, past precedents and potential solutions to come up with an acceptable
        resolution. 4. Problem-Solving Skills At its core, the MUN is based on problem-solving skills, as it places you at the centre of an organization designated to resolving global issues (albeit simulated). Thus, problem-solving is a skill that you
        will have to hone from the beginning of the MUN itself, learning how to identify the key components of a topic, determining factors to be kept in mind while deciding on the solution, and putting it all together to come up with a final resolution
        that satisfies all concerned countries. Recommended Read: 6 Ways Summer Schools Can Be A Gateway To Your Dream College & Course 5. Diplomacy Diplomacy, or the art of negotiation, is not only restricted to conversations between two countries, but
        pertains to any purposeful exchange between two groups, and thus, is a very useful skill to possess. By practising diplomacy at the MUNs, you will become more knowledgeable and experienced on how to conduct negotiations between two groups in a
        tactful and result-oriented manner. Apart from learning the skill of diplomacy, students aspiring to become professional diplomats can practice and groom themselves for the field by participating in MUNs, which are a real-life example of the life
        and work of professional diplomats. 6. Public Speaking Developing efficient public speaking skills takes practice, and the MUNs provide an ideal platform where you can explore and improve your capabilities. Public speaking is an integral part
        of the MUNs, as you express your views and debate in front of an audience. Since you will make multiple speeches during the overall MUN event, you will have several opportunities to improve your public speaking prowess. Recommended Read: The Art

        organizers, co-sponsors, judges, and chairs of the event. By making new contacts and meeting possible mentors, you can cultivate your network for future use. Recommended Read: Social Media Can Help Boost Your Career: Here are 5 Ways (And Examples)!
        8. Writing Skills There is a hefty amount of writing involved at MUNs, including writing for speeches, writing position papers on the topic given for resolution, possible amendments, and finally, writing the resolution itself. In comparison to
        the writing you do at school, the writing you will work on in MUNs is a lot more disciplined and requires more creativity. Each writing piece involves research and analysis and will serve to groom your writing skills, a useful skill for college
        and professional life. Recommended Read: An Expert’s Guide (That Actually Works!) to Improve English Language Skills 9. Leadership Skills Considering all the benefits listed above, it is not a stretch to claim that your personality will flourish
        at MUNs. The independence, challenges, and teamwork will surely serve to enhance your leadership skills, as you take charge as a representative of a real-world country. You will be encouraged to take decisions and work out solutions as a leader
        for the country. 10. College Applications MUNs are known for their quality, high standards, and difficulty levels, and participating in one will work as an asset when you apply for colleges and/or jobs. Top Ivy League colleges such as Yale and
        Harvard have been known to give additional consideration to students who have attended MUNs. Even Indian universities are beginning to hold profile-based admissions (such as Liberal Arts colleges), where they assign significant weightage to extra-curricular
        activities. Admissions officers and job interviewers look for candidates with discipline, confidence, analytical ability, and problem-solving skills; all traits that are exemplified by participating in MUNs.
